TikTok results in vandalism.
Last fall, TikTok users posted content challenging users to destroy school bathrooms. Bathrooms everywhere were vandalized.
TikTok stories are disappointing.
TikTok stories don’t hold a candle to Instagram stories.
TikTok wastes your time.
At times, the advantages and disadvantages of TikTok can be the same.
I realize I indicated using TikTok to pass the time is an advantage of TikTok. However, if you are using scrolling through TikTok to procrastinate, then spending time on TikTok becomes wasting time on TikTok which is a disadvantage of using TikTok.
 TikTok’s algorithm is hard to predict.
