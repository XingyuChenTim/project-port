TikTok is entertaining.
Isn’t ”entertaining” subject to opinion?
No!
The algorithm learns what interests you and only shows you that content.
You can see anything your heart desires on TikTok:
Singing, dancing, magic tricks, dog tricks, tarot card readers, stand-up comics, funny animals, cute babies, fitness tips, and esteem-enhancing positivity are just a few of the types of videos shared on the platform.
Many of these video makers host live events.
TikTok is life-changing.

First, users hear songs they haven’t heard in years and are reminded of days gone by.
Next, users hear songs they forgot they liked and rush to Spotify to add the songs to their playlists, so they can keep enjoying them.
Finally, new artists get discovered on TikTok with the help of the platform.
For instance, TikTok pushes out the songs of up and coming artists. Hashtags like #ClassicalMusic help make older genres popular.
Have you heard of popular TikTokker Charli D’amelio? Charli has over 141.2 million followers.  TikTok certainly changed her life. I saw her dancing on a television special event with established stars. Thanks to TikTok, Charlie is a celebrity.
TikTok’s videos are easy to repurpose.
Since TikTok’s videos are vertical, you can easily upload them onto YouTube Shorts which is also vertical.
Instagram Stories are vertical as well. After uploading to TikTok, you’ll be asked if you want to repurpose your video onto Instagram.
TikTok makes you happy.
This claim is based on research.
A study revealed viewers’ endorphins rose after watching TikTok videos.
With all the cute puppies and babies you find on TikTok, how could you not feel happy?
TikTok is a great distraction.
Life got you down? Try scrolling through content tagged with hashtags such as #FunnyVideos or #FunnyDogVideos and then see if you can recall what preoccupied your thoughts.  In the comments section, share what successfully distracts you and share if you consider the distraction one of the advantages or disadvantages of TikTok.
TikTok is easy to learn to use.
I do not consider myself tech-savvy. However, it felt like I was off and running the moment I started making my first TikTok video.
