    "## You can start by using the Tokenizer utility class\n",
    "##  which can vectorize a text corpus into a list of integers. \n",
    "## Each integer maps to a value in a dictionary that encodes \n",
    "## the entire corpus, with the keys in the dictionary being \n",
    "## the vocabulary terms themselves. You can add the parameter num_words, \n",
