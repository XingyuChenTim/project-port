	•	Perhaps because of the interface and the relatable way that individuals are portrayed in any TikTok, users feel very comfortable to be themselves and to share compelling, creative bite-sized videos with others. The app has also been the location where memes originate and go viral, new phrases where challenges are posted and receive participation from all over the world, and a favorite platform of many celebrities.
	•	It is arguably easier to edit content in TikTok than in other apps like Snapchat and Instagram. The filters and functionality to modify and improve your video are actually enjoyable to use.
	•	There is always something original to explore because it’s a mirror of current social trends, and benefits from new songs being released (and featured) all of the time.
	•	It is just really fun. In unique and inviting ways.
