1. Your Teen Could  Potentially Get Exposed to Sexual Predators 


While the ​platform is working hard​ on mitigating issues concerning sexual predators reaching out to underaged kids, this issue is still prevalent on TikTok. Even though the platform is aimed at younger users, there are still many older users too, which is completely fine – who are we to judge how you express yourself!? However, if these older individuals send explicit messages and images to teens (or worse, to kids who should not be on the app in the first place), it becomes problematic. There have been numerous instances where parents had to report predatory behavior to law enforcement. So, beware!



2. It Can Harm Privacy 



Also, TikTok can harm yours and your teens’ privacy. Generally, teens aren’t aware of ​the privacy concerns​ that come with putting their lives on display for others. Often, they film in front of their homes, show off their homes' interiors, share their locations, show off their parents' cars, and display license plates, etc. The world is full of crazy people, and it only takes one bold enough to use this information for malicious purposes. That’s why ​you should consider installing a VPN​ on your teen’s device. What is a VPN? VPNs are software solutions that act as a gateway between the user and the web. They will conceal the user’s original IP address, ensuring that their online activities remain private and secure. 
 

3. It’s Prone to Negative Comments 


Negativity is a prevalent issue with all social media platforms these days. The more one uses a platform, the greater the chances of receiving negative comments. Even the platform’s top creators have expressed concerns in regards to negative comments. Even they feel worried and insecure when reading them. Negative comments can severely impact one’s self-esteem and confidence, and even result in self-harm or body image issues. Teens must be resilient if they are going to use this app to post videos.
