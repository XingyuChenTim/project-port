TikTok helps you promote causes.
You can effect positive change with your TikTok content.
For instance, American Idol contestant Taylor Fagins sang his original anti-racism song on TikTok in order to promote the #BlackLivesMatter movement.
TikTok keeps reinventing itself.
TikTok increased the length of video uploads.
TikTok is starting a live subscription program.
TikTok started live events.
TikTok is developing a monetization program for creators.

Organic growth is easier.
Growing on new social media platforms is easier than on platforms with more longevity.
For this reason, organic growth on TikTok is easier than organic growth on Instagram and on other social media sites where half of all marketers pay to promote their content and boost their visibility.
In addition, TikTok offers ways to easily grow on TikTok such as Follow Trains. TikTok has Follow Trains for all sorts of demographics. For instance, the author Follow Train is called ”BookTok.” Just search the Discover tab for #FollowTrains to find the demographic that interests you.
Also, TikTok offers metrics that are easy to understand. You can replicate the variables of your successful content in order to replicate your success. For instance, you can replicate the video length.
It gets better: You don’t need a boatload of social media followers to succeed on TikTok. You succeed on TikTok when you get waves of views. This occurs when the platform pushes your video to users’ For You Pages. Landing on the For You Page is how you get massive exposure.
TikTok is educational.
When Facebook and Instagram first experienced explosive growth, teachers took advantage of those social media sites’ appeal with students to use the sites for educational purposes.
For instance, I know a history teacher who had a Facebook page devoted to announcing homework, due dates, and tests.
Why should TikTok’s appeal be an exception?
Science teacher Greg Wolf does science demonstrations in TikTok videos. Is it any surprise that his videos are going viral?
