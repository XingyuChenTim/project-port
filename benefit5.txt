For instance, TikTok has hashtags for popular educational content such as #STEMTok (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) and #LearnonTikTok.
The #teachersofTikTok hashtag allows teachers to share ideas with students and each other. As you can see, instruction on TikTok is widespread.
TikTok provides networking opportunities.
As with all social media sites, TikTok enables you to find people with common interests.
Click ”Discover” to find what’s trending.
For example, in late May, ”coffee” was trending. I love coffee. Over 30 billion videos were uploaded with the hashtag. Do you see how easy it is to use TikTok to find people with similar interests?
If you have an interest that isn’t trending, in other words, surging in popularity, search for it using the search bar.
TikTok boosts your self-esteem.
Regardless of followers, any video can outperform your others at any time.
I know I felt great when one of my videos received over 5,000 views, especially after only a short time on the platform.
Also, I don’t normally consider myself creative, but when I see the results of my video-editing efforts, I feel pride.
That boost of self-esteem doesn’t have to be short-lived either.
You can post up to three TikTok videos at the top of your profile. This way you and people who view your profile can see your video creations.
Marketing is easier.
The data in this infographic clearly shows the effectiveness of TikTok marketing in contrast to other forms of social media marketing.
The Duolingo language learning app started the TikTok marketing trend. Now TikTok marketing is widespread.
TikTok helps shoppers.
You have plenty of opportunities to make purchases on TikTok.
In the bottom-left corner of the video screen, you will see the word “sponsored.” Then you know the items described in the video are for sale.
