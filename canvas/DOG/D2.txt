Rescuing dogs is wonderful, fullfilling, and healthy for you and your family. Dogs can add love and companionship.
Never leave your dog in the car, ever. Dogs need attention. Do not leave your dog home alone or locked in a box. 
Think about how you would like to be treated, and treat your dog the same way.
