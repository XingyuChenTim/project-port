Since I was dressing my dog to walk on a cold day, I thought to have the snow come down on us. Even our commenter remarked how amazing the filter is.
TikTok offers seasonal filters like these snowflakes which I used in the winter. You don’t have to look far for seasonally appropriate filters since TikTok recommends them to you.
TikTok is a powerful time killer.
Do you ever find you have a few moments to kill with nothing to do? TikTok is an effective cure for boredom.
TikTok provides free music.
You can get free music for offline use when you do a TikTok MP3 download.
Free tools are available that allow you to download a portion of TikTok’s music.
TikTok’s editing features are a cut above the rest.

TikTok’s effects get more impressive as time goes on which says a great deal. I consider the effects better than Instagram’s or a third-party video editor. I don’t know how TikTok consistently tops itself.
Easily Splice video content together. Choose your desired length.
Seven seconds is a popular video length, so you won’t be engaged in video editing for too long.
The best part: When you use the native TikTok editor, TikTok rewards you with more visibility.
TikTok has inspiring music for every video’s mood. You won’t need to worry about a copy-write claim.
Remember to use text and captions which take viewers longer to read. For this reason, using text boosts your video watch time.
The result: TikTok shows your video to more people.
You can even use your still photos on TikTok which provides templates for you to use.
