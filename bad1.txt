Short Videos Are Addictive
One issue with apps like TikTok is that the shorts they put in front of you are so personalized. When you first join the app, you receive general videos that aren’t yet catered to the content you gravitate towards. But as the app gets to know your preferences, it delivers videos that match your taste. That’s where things get dicey. A study on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, found that when people watch personalized videos on the app, the reward centers of their brains light up, as do areas associated with addiction. These areas don’t light up while watching the general videos.
This isn’t surprising, as social media platforms are designed to keep users engaged for as long as possible. But because these apps quickly learn what content users like and then feed it to them on a silver platter, it can lead people to stay on the app longer than they had originally intended. This could drive addiction-like behavior.
Internet use usually becomes problematic when people spend too much time online, which is exactly what the apps are so good at getting you to do. Problematic use is associated with addiction-like symptoms such as loss of control, withdrawal, failure to reduce use, and other negative consequences, according to a 2015 study. People who have social anxiety or are experiencing social isolation are most likely to develop addiction-like symptoms, which isn’t great for any of us as we live through a pandemic.
